4) increase size of this list by one.

remove first method
1. check is size is smaller than zero if yes throw and exception 
2. creat a nn and assign it to this.head.next
3.then this.head.next assign to nn.next to pu the new node in the right spot
4.decrement the size 
5. retun the data of the node that was removed

contain method

1. check if the head is null in another word if it is an empy list
2.creat a for look in that creat a new node name cur assign it to this.head.next
3. walk it through till cur.next == null by increamenting cu=cur.next
4.if statement if the object we want to find is null and cur.data is nulll (OR) cur.data .equal(objct) return true
5 else return false 

boolean remove(Object o) method

1. creat NEW NODE ListNode cur =this.head.next assign it to the head.next
2. creat another node call ir prev to assign it to the one before cur which is this.head
